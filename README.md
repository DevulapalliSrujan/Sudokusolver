Sudoku Solver
Project Description:
This Python-based Sudoku solver is designed to take a user-inputted 9x9 Sudoku puzzle and solve it using a backtracking algorithm. The program efficiently fills in the missing numbers while adhering to Sudoku rules.

Features:
User Input Handling: Users enter the puzzle row by row, with 0 representing empty cells.
Validation Checks: Ensures the input contains only valid numbers (0-9) and is properly formatted.

How It Works:
The user inputs a Sudoku puzzle (9 rows, each containing 9 numbers separated by spaces).
The program validates the input and stores it in a 9x9 grid.
The solve_sudoku() function employs a backtracking algorithm to find a valid solution.
If a solution is found, the completed Sudoku grid is displayed; otherwise, the program states that no solution exists.

Usage:
Run the script and input the Sudoku grid when prompted. The solver will attempt to find a valid solution and print it in a structured format.

Technologies Used:
Python
